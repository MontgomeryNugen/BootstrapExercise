    <h1>History</h1>

    <h3>Who created the language?</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>For what purpose was it created?</h3>
    <h4>COBOL was designed for finance, human resources and other business computer
        programs. Unlike some high-level computer programming languages, COBOL uses
        English words and phrases to make it easier for ordinary business users to
        understand. The language was based on Rear Admiral Grace Hopper's 1940s
        work on the FLOW-MATIC programming language, which was also largely
        text-based.  Hopper, who worked as a technical consultant on the FLOW-MATIC
        project, is sometimes referred to as the "grandmother of COBOL."</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Before COBOL, all operating systems had their own associated programming
        languages. This was a problem for companies that used multiple brands of
        computers, as was the case with the United States Department of Defense,
        which backed the COBOL project. Because of its ease of use and portability,
        COBOL quickly became one of the most used programming languages in the
        world. Although the language is widely viewed as outdated, more lines
        of code in active use today are written in COBOL than any other programming
        language.</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Fifty years ago, each computer maker used its own programming languages to tell a computer what to do. In 1959, a group of programmers devised COBOL, a COmmon, Business-Oriented Language. Programs written in COBOL could run on more than one manufacturerâ€™s computer. In a 1960 test, the same COBOL programs ran successfully on two computers built by different manufacturers.

        <br><br>    A small group of programmers from the computer industry and its clients wrote the new language of COBOL. Both corporations and government agencies needed to maintain payrolls, prepare budgets, and track property, traditional aspects of business data processing. The Department of Defense was especially interested as it was one of few organizations to buy computers from different makers. COBOL was quickly adopted there, in other federal agencies, and in private industry. Additional common languages, such as ALGOL and standard forms of FORTRAN, were developed for scientists and engineers.
            
        <br> <br>  Written initially for the short range, COBOL proved so useful that it dominated much of government and business data processing for decades. Millions of banking transactions are still processed daily with COBOL programs. As the use of common programming languages became standard, a flourishing independent computer software industry emerged.</h4>
    <br>    
        <h3>Is the language still is use today?</h3>
    <h4>In years immediately preceding the year 2000, COBOL skills were in high demand
        to prepare legacy code for Y2K. It is still commonly used at financial institutions,
        such as banks, and by applications used in government agencies. However, the
        number of programmers with COBOL experience is steadily decreasing, as those
        who learned COBOL while it was popular are entering retirement age. 
        Suprisingly, COBOL is once again being taught in some universities -- this
        time to support application modernization and the DevOps movement.
        <br>
        <br>
        While many organizations do still use the language, the lack of skills and
        burdensome text-based code is beginning to be replaced or integrated with more
        modern coding languages, such as Java, .NET, and C++. However, this can be a
        complicated and costly process, as these programs are often run on legacy
        mainframes that are difficult to replace, and because of the sheer amount of
        code still in use. After the turn of the century, the demand for COBOL
        programmers was not as great and many schools stopped teaching the language.</h4>
